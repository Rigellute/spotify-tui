A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12150276/64545371-84af3580-d320-11e9-867d-c368fd888b3b.gif)

The terminal in the demo above is using the [Rigel theme](https://rigel.netlify.com/).

## Installation

The binary executable is `spt`.

### Homebrew

For both macOS and Linux

```bash
brew install Rigellute/tap/spotify-tui
```

To update, run

```bash
brew upgrade spotify-tui
```

### Snap

For a system with Snap installed, run

```bash
snap install spt --channel=edge
```

The latest version will be installed for you automatically.

### AUR

For those on Arch Linux you can find the package on AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify-tui/). If however you're using an AUR helper you can install directly from that, for example (in the case of [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)), run

```bash
yay -S spotify-tui
```

### Void Linux

Available on the official repositories. To install, run

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Su spotify-tui
```

### Cargo

Use this option if your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases).

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then

```bash
cargo install spotify-tui
```

This method will build the binary from source.

To update, run

```bash
cargo install spotify-tui --force
```

#### Note on Linux

For compilation on Linux the development packages for `libssl` are required.
For basic installation instructions, see [install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic).
In order to locate dependencies, the compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.

If you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll need to [install additional dependencies](#windows-subsystem-for-linux).

### Manual

1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) for your OS.
1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip
1. `cd` to `spotify-ui` and run with `./spt`

## Connecting to Spotify’s API

`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by
name, play tracks etc.

Instructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.

But here they are again:

1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
1. Click `Create a Client ID` and create an app
1. Now click `Edit Settings`
1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
1. Go back to the terminal
1. Run `spt`
1. Enter your `Client ID`
1. Enter your `Client Secret`
1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
1. After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you're done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you'll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.

And now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` 🎉

You can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`.

## Usage

The binary is named `spt`.

When running `spotify-tui` press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.

# Configuration

A configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`
(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)

The following is a sample config.yml file:

```yaml
# Sample config file

behavior:
  seek_milliseconds: 5000

keybindings:
  # Key stroke can be used if it only uses two keys:
  # ctrl-q works,
  # ctrl-alt-q doesn't.
  back: "ctrl-q"

  jump_to_album: "a"

  # Shift modifiers use a capital letter (also applies with other modifier keys
  # like ctrl-A)
  jump_to_artist_album: "A"

  manage_devices: "d"
  decrease_volume: "-"
  increase_volume: "+"
  toggle_playback: " "
  seek_backwards: "<"
  seek_forwards: ">"
  next_track: "n"
  previous_track: "p"
  copy_song_url: "c"
  copy_album_url: "C"
  help: "?"
  shuffle: "s"
  repeat: "r"
  search: "/"
```

## Limitations

This app uses the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself. So you'll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).

If you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.

## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

Follow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.

After that there is not much to it.

1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.
1. Start up `spt`
1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd "device" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)

## Libraries used

- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)

## Development

1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)
1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it
1. And then `cargo run`

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

You might get a linking error. If so, you'll probably need to install additional dependencies required by the clipboard package

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y -qq pkg-config libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

## Roadmap

The goal is to eventually implement almost every Spotify feature.

### High level requirements yet to be implemented

- Add songs to a playlist
- Be able to scroll through result pages in every view
- View Library "Made for you"

This table shows all that is possible with the Spotify API, what is implemented already, and whether that is essential.

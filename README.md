A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12150276/64545371-84af3580-d320-11e9-867d-c368fd888b3b.gif)

The terminal in the demo above is using the [Rigel theme](https://rigel.netlify.com/).

## Installation

The binary executable is `spt`.

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install Rigellute/tap/spotify-tui
```

### Cargo (Linux)

Eventually, there should be prebuilt binaries available in the Github release, but until then you can install via Rust's package manager `cargo`.

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then

```bash
cargo install spotify-tui
```

This method will build the binary from source, so has the benefit of supporting more architectures.

I've only tested on Ubuntu and Debian, but I expect this to work on other Linux distros.

### Manual

1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) (currently only for macOS).
1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip
1. `cd` to `spotify-ui` and run with `./spt`

## Connecting to Spotify’s API

`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by
name, play tracks etc.

Instructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.

But here they are again:

1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
1. Click `Create a Client ID` and create an app
1. Now click `Edit Settings`
1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
1. Go back to the terminal
1. Run `spt`
1. Enter your `Client ID`
1. Enter your `Client Secret`
1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
1. After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost (blank webpage, might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running), copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.

And now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` 🎉

You can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`.

## Usage

The binary is named `spt`.

When running `spotify-tui` press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.

## Limitations

This app uses the Web API from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself. So you'll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).

If you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.

## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

Follow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.

After that there is not much to it.

1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.
1. Start up `spt`
1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd "device" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)

## Libraries used

- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)

## Development

1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it
1. And then `cargo run`

## Roadmap

The goal is to eventually implement almost every Spotify feature.

### High level requirements yet to be implemented

- Add songs to a playlist
- Be able to like songs in every view, and see that a given track is already liked.
- Unlike songs
- See if a song is liked
- Be able to scroll through result pages in every view
- View Library "Made for you"
- View Library "Artists"
- Make the play bar hoverable with its own event handlers that would
  - Like the playing song
  - Navigate to song info

This table shows all that is possible with the Spotify API, what is implemented already, and whether that is essential.
